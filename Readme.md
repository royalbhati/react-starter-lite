But you still get it.

Simple base app with react, hot-reload &amp; css.

`npx react-starter-lite` to install the package.

## What is this

This is a base project that you can use to start your react apps but we have CRA?
I know,this has a simple boilerplate as compared to CRA and lite.Enough to get your hands dirty

## Issues

npm install is not working as expected use `npx react-starter-lite`
