But you still get it.

Simple base app with react, hot-reload &amp; css.

`npx react-starter-lite` to install the package.

## What is this

This is a base project that you can use to start your react project, but we already have CRA 😠 ?
I know but I dont like it 🤷‍♂,this has a simple boilerplate as compared to CRA and lite.
Enough to get your hands dirty 🔥

## Issues

npm install is not working as expected use `npx react-starter-lite`
